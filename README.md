# tutorials-tf-api
This is NOT A MACHINE LEARNING tutorial. The purpose of the notebook is to demonstrate the usage of tensorflow APIs which are commonly used when you are writing your own ML libraries. We are mainly targetting tf-2.0 but the usage of most of the API's would be similar in the earlier versions as well (run it in eager execution).

This is a work in progress. More examples and explainations for the existing examples would be added.

Currently myself and [Xu Zheng](https://github.com/zhengxu001) are maintaining this repo. We would be really happy if you can collaborate and help us to make this better.
